    <h2>The Metamorphosis</h2>
      <p>One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he
      discovered that in bed he had been changed into a <strong>monstrous verminous bug</strong>.
      He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little,
      his brown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow-like sections. From this
      height the blanket, just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place.
      His numerous legs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his circumference,
      flickered helplessly before his eyes.</p>

    <h2>"What's happened to me," he thought.</h2>
      <p>It was no dream. His room, a proper room for a human being, only somewhat
      too small, lay quietly between the four well-known walls. Above the table,
      on which an unpacked collection of sample cloth goods was spread out (Samsa
      was a traveling salesman) hung the picture which he had cut out of an illustrated
      magazine a little while ago and set in a pretty gilt frame. It was a picture of
      a woman with a fur hat and a fur boa. She sat erect there, lifting up in the
      direction of the viewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm disappeared.</p>

    <h2>Gregor’s glance then turned to the window.</h2>
      <p>The dreary weather (the rain drops were falling audibly down on the metal
        window ledge) made him quite melancholy. ‘Why don’t I keep sleeping for a little
        while longer and forget all this foolishness,’ he thought. But this was entirely
        impractical, for he was used to sleeping on his right side, and in his present state
        he couldn’t get himself into this position. No matter how hard he threw himself onto
        his right side, he always rolled again onto his back. He must have tried it a hundred
        times, closing his eyes, so that he would not have to see the wriggling legs, and gave
        up only when he began to feel a light, dull pain in his side which he had never felt before.</p>
